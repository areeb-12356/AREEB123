                        <h5> What you need </h5>

                        <h2>square sheet of paper (any size; thin paper works best)</h2>

                        <h3>1. Start with a square:</h3>

                        Place the paper colored side down (if it has one).

                        <h3>2. Make diagonal folds:</h3>

                        Fold the paper in half diagonally (corner to corner).Unfold

                        Fold diagonally the other way.

                        Unfold again.

                        You should see an X crease.

                        <h3>3. Fold in half horizontally and vertically:</h3>

                        Fold the paper in half (top to bottom), then unfold.

                        Fold it in half again (left to right), then unfold.

                        Now you have 8 crease lines.

                        <h3>4. Form a square base:</h3>

                        Hold the paper and gently push the sides inward.

                        The paper will collapse into a smaller square (called a square base).

                        Make sure the open ends face you.

                        <h3>5. Make a kite shape:</h3>

                        Take the top layer only.

                        Fold the left edge to the center line.

                        Fold the right edge to the center line.

                        Fold the top triangle down.

                        Unfold all three folds.

                        <h3>6. Make the inside reverse fold:</h3>

                        Lift the top flap.

                        Open it and fold it upward, using the creases you just made.

                        Flatten it into a long diamond shape.

                        Turn the model over and repeat Step 5 and 6 on the other side.

                        <h3>7. Fold the neck and tail:</h3>

                        Take one of the long thin points.

                        Fold it upward diagonally.

                        Repeat with the other thin point.

                        <h3>8. Make the head:</h3>

                        Choose one thin point to be the head.

                        Fold the tip down slightly to form the beak.

                        <h3>9. Fold down the:</h3> wings

                        Hold the body.

                        Fold each large flap (wing) downward.

                        <h3>10. Gently pull :</h3>the wings apart

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        <h2> square sheet of paper:</h2>
                        (Any size; colored paper looks best)

                        <h3>1. Start with a square:</h3>

                        Place the paper colored side down.

                        <h3>2. Fold diagonally:</h3>

                        Fold the paper corner to corner to make a triangle.

                        Crease well.

                        <h3>3. Fold again:</h3>

                        Fold the triangle in half to make a smaller triangle.

                        <h3>4. Create the petals:</h3>

                        Take the left corner of the triangle and fold it upward.

                        Take the right corner and fold it upward the same way.

                        The folds should look like two rabbit ears.

                        <h3>5. Flip the model:</h3>

                        Turn the paper over carefully.

                        <h3>6. Fold the bottom up:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom point upward to the top.

                        Crease well.

                        <h3>7. Turn over again:</h3>

                        Flip it back to the front.

                        <h3> 8. Open the flower:</h3>

                        Gently pull the petals apart.

                        Flatten the center slightly.

                        <h5> What you need</h5>
                        <h3> 1. Start with the color side down:</h3>

                        Place the paper on a flat surface with the color side facing down.

                        <h3>2. Fold in half diagonally:</h3>

                        Fold the paper corner to corner to make a triangle.
                        Crease well, then unfold.

                        <h3>3. Fold the other diagonal:</h3>

                        Fold along the other diagonal to make another triangle.
                        Crease and unfold again.

                        <h3> 4. Fold in half horizontally:</h3>

                        Fold the paper top to bottom (edge to edge).
                        Crease and unfold.

                        <h3> 5. Fold in half vertically:</h3>

                        Fold left to right, crease, then unfold.
                        You should now see several crease lines forming a star or grid.

                        <h3>6. Collapse into a triangle base:</h3>

                        Gently push the left and right sides inward

                        The paper will naturally collapse into a flat triangle (called a waterbomb base)

                        <h3>7. Fold the bottom corners up:</h3>

                        Take the two bottom corners of the triangle and fold them up to the top point.

                        <h3>8. Flip the paper over:</h3>

                        Turn the model over carefully.

                        <h3> 9. Fold the top point down:</h3>

                        Fold the top triangle point down, letting it slightly extend past the bottom edge.

                        <h3>10. Fold in half:</h3>

                        Fold the butterfly in half vertically, wings outward.

                        <h3> 11. Shape the wings</h3>

                        Gently pull the wings apart and adjust their shape with your fingers.

                        <h3>1. Start with the color side down:</h3>

                        Place the paper flat on the table with the colored side facing down.

                        <h3>2. Fold in half diagonally:</h3>

                        Fold the paper corner to corner to make a triangle.
                        Crease well.

                        <h3>3. Turn the triangle:</h3>

                        Rotate it so the long edge is at the bottom and the point faces up.

                        <h3> 4. Fold the ears:</h3>

                        Fold the left corner down and outward to make one ear

                        Fold the right corner down and outward to make the other ear
                        (The ears should be pointed and symmetrical.)

                        <h3>5. Fold the top point down:</h3>

                        Fold the top point downward slightly to shape the fox's forehead.

                        <h3>6. Fold the bottom point up:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom point upward to create the fox's nose and muzzle.

                        <h3>7. Adjust the shape:</h3>

                        Gently adjust the folds so the fox face looks balanced.

                        <h3>8. Draw the face</h3>

                        Use a pen or marker to draw:

                        Two eyes

                        A small triangle nose

                        Whiskers (optional)

                        Crease and keep it folded.

                        <h3> 4. Create the wings:</h3>

                        Take the top flap and fold it downward at an angle to form one wing

                        Flip the paper over

                        Fold the other flap down to match the first wing

                        <h3> 5. Make the head:</h3>

                        Fold a small tip at the front upward or downward

                        This creates the bird's beak/head

                        <h3> 6. Shape the bird</h3>

                        Gently open and adjust the wings so the bird can stand or look like it's flying.

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        <h3>1. Start with the color side down:</h3>

                        Place the paper flat on the table with the colored side facing down.

                        <h3>2. Fold in half:</h3>

                        Fold the paper top to bottom to make a rectangle.
                        Crease well, then unfold.

                        <h3>3. Fold in half the other way:</h3>

                        Fold left to right to make another rectangle.
                        Crease and unfold again.

                        <h3>4. Fold diagonally:</h3>

                        Fold the paper corner to corner to make a triangle.
                        Unfold.

                        <h3>5. Fold the other diagonal:</h3>

                        Fold along the other diagonal, then unfold.
                        You should now see several crease lines crossing in the center.

                        <h3>6. Collapse into a star shape:</h3>

                        Gently push the paper inward along the creases so it begins to form points.

                        <h3>7. Shape the star:</h3>

                        Press the folds flat and adjust the points to make a five-point star shape.

                        <h3>8. Flatten and decorate</h3>

                        Flatten the star and decorate it with markers or glitter if you like.

                        <h3>1. Start with the color side down:</h3>

                        Place the paper flat with the colored side facing down.

                        <h3>2. Fold in half:</h3>

                        Fold the paper top to bottom to make a rectangle.

                        <h3>3. Fold in half again:</h3>

                        Fold left to right to make a smaller square.
                        Crease, then unfold this last fold.

                        <h3>4. Make the head shape:</h3>

                        Fold the top two corners down slightly to round the head.

                        <h3>5. Make the chin:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom edge up a little to form the chin.

                        <h3>6. Flip over:</h3>

                        Turn the paper over so the front of the face is visible.

                        <h3>7. Draw the face:</h3>

                        Use a pen or marker to add:

                        Eyes

                        Nose

                        You should see a cross in the center.

                        <h3>4. Fold corners to the center:</h3>

                        Fold all four corners inward so they meet at the center point.

                        <h3>5. Fold top and bottom edges to the center:</h3>

                        Fold the top edge down to the center line.
                        Fold the bottom edge up to the center line.

                        <h3> 6. Unfold the top and bottom edges:</h3>

                        Keep the corners folded, but unfold the top and bottom edges you just made.

                        <h3>7. Open the box sides:</h3>

                        Lift the left and right sides up while gently pushing the corners inward.
                        The box will begin to form.

                        <h3>8. Shape the box:</h3>

                        Press the sides firmly and adjust the corners so the box stands neatly.

                        <h4>1 rectangular sheet of paper (A4 or Letter):</h4>

                        <h3>1. Fold in half lengthwise:</h3>

                        Fold the paper in half from top to bottom. Crease well, then unfold.

                        <h3>2. Fold the top corners in:</h3>

                        Take the top left and top right corners and fold them inward so they meet the center crease. It

                        should look like a triangle at the top.

                        <h3>3. Fold the new top edges in again:</h3>

                        Fold the slanted edges in toward the center crease one more time to make a sharp nose.

                        <h3>4. Fold the plane in half:</h3>

                        Fold the whole paper along the original center crease, with the folded edges on the inside.

                        Make the wings

                        On one side, fold the top layer down to form a wing. Flip over and repeat on the other side. Try

                        to keep both wings the same size.

                        Adjust and fly!
                        Gently open the wings, hold the plane under the wings, and give it a smooth throw 🚀

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 square sheet of paper
                        (If you only have a rectangle, cut it into a square first)

                        <h3>1. Fold in half vertically:</h3>
                        Fold the square in half from left to right. Crease, then unfold.

                        <h3>2. Fold in half horizontally:</h3>
                        Fold from top to bottom. Crease, then unfold.
                        You should see a “+” crease in the middle.

                        <h3>3. Fold the bottom edge up:</h3>
                        Fold the bottom edge up to the center crease.

                        <h3>4. Fold the top corners down:</h3>
                        Take the top left and top right corners and fold them diagonally down to the center line. This
                        starts forming the heart shape.

                        <h3>5. Round the heart:</h3>
                        Fold the small side corners inward to soften the shape.

                        <h3>6. Fold the top points down:</h3>
                        Fold the sharp top points slightly downward to make the heart round and smooth.

                        Turn it over
                        Flip the paper over—you've got a heart! 💖

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 sheet of rectangular paper (A4 size works best)

                        <h3>1. Fold in Half:</h3>

                        Hold the paper horizontally (wide side towards you).

                        Fold it top to bottom so the top edge meets the bottom edge.

                        Press the fold gently to crease.

                        <h3>2. Fold in Half Again:</h3>

                        Now fold the paper left to right.

                        Press to crease, then open it back.

                        You will see a center line — this helps alignment.

                        <h3>3. Make the Triangle Top:</h3>

                        Fold the top-left corner down toward the center line.

                        Fold the top-right corner down toward the center line.

                        Now the top looks like a triangle, and there are flaps at the bottom.

                        <h3>4. Fold the Bottom Flaps Up:</h3>

                        Take the front bottom flap and fold it up.

                        Flip the paper over.

                        Fold the other bottom flap up.

                        <h3>5. Open into a Square:</h3>

                        Hold the boat from the open part at the bottom.

                        Gently pull apart to open the shape.

                        Press the corners to flatten into a square.

                        <h3>6. Fold Bottom Flaps Again:</h3>

                        You now have a diamond/square shape.

                        Fold the bottom point up to the top.

                        Flip over and fold the other bottom point to the top.

                        <h3>7. Final Opening:</h3>

                        Hold the bottom open edges.

                        Gently pull apart and open again.

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        Square paper sheets (6 cm-10 cm size works well)

                        60 sheets total (5 petals X 12 flowers)

                        <h3>1. Start with a Square:</h3>

                        Place 1 square paper flat on the table.

                        <h3>2. Fold Diagonal:</h3>

                        Fold it corner to corner to make a triangle.

                        Press crease gently.

                        <h3>3. Fold Corners Up:</h3>

                        Take the right corner of the triangle and fold it up to the top point.

                        Take the left corner and fold it to the top point.

                        Now it looks like a diamond / house shape.

                        <h3>4. Fold Flaps Outward:</h3>

                        Open the two flaps slightly and press them flat outward.

                        They become kite shapes on each side.

                        <h3>5. Fold Tips Down:</h3>

                        On each kite, fold the small top tips downward so they align with the edges.

                        <h3>6. Fold Wings In:</h3>

                        Fold each side inward along the original creases.

                        Now you will see a petal shape forming.

                        <h3>7. Close the Petal:</h3>

                        Apply a little glue on one inner wing edge.

                        Bring the two sides together and hold for a few seconds.

                        → One petal is complete!

                        <h3>8. Make 5 Petals:</h3>

                        Repeat Part A until you have 5 petals.

                        <h3>9. Join Petals Together:</h3>

                        Put glue on the side of one petal.

                        Attach a second petal to it.

                        Continue until 5 petals form a full flower.

                        → One kusudama flower is now done.

                        <h3>10. Make 12 Flowers</h3>

                        Repeat the flower process until you have 12 flowers.

                        <h3>11. Join Flowers Slowly:</h3>

                        Add glue to touching petals.

                        Join flowers one by one.

                        Shape them into a round ball as you connect.

                        <h3>12. Final Adjustments:</h3>

                        Press gently so it holds shape.

                        Let the ball dry for 10-20 minutes.

                        <p>
                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 square sheet of paper (size 15x15 cm works well)

                        A flat table

                        No tools required

                        <h3>1. Start with a Square:</h3>

                        Place the paper color side down (if colored).

                        <h3>2. Fold in Half (Both Directions):</h3>

                        Fold left to right, crease, open.

                        Fold top to bottom, crease, open.
                        This creates a “+” shape crease.

                        <h3>3. Fold Diagonally:</h3>

                        Fold corner to corner, crease, open.

                        Fold opposite corners, crease, open.
                        Now you have a “X” and “+” combined.

                        <h3>4. Mark the Center Square:</h3>

                        Fold each side edge gently to the center crease (do NOT crease hard).

                        Leave a small square in the center with light marks.
                        This will guide the twist.

                        <h3>5. Make the Central Square Crease:</h3>

                        Using the light marks, fold a small square in the center by:

                        Folding top edge toward center

                        Folding bottom edge toward center

                        Folding left edge toward center

                        Folding right edge toward center

                        Press gently so the center square is clear.

                        <h3>6. Create Triangle Corners:</h3>

                        From each side of the center square, fold a triangle inward:

                        Pull one corner of the big square toward the nearest corner of the center square

                        Press the fold lightly

                        Repeat for all 4 corners

                        Now you will see four triangle shapes around the small square.

                        <h3>7. Collapse the Twist:</h3>

                        Now we push it into shape:

                        Hold the paper flat.

                        Lightly pinch the four triangles at their tips.

                        Gently push inward toward the center.

                        The center square will sink down and twist by 90 degrees.

                        Take your time—there's no rush.

                        <h3>8. Flatten the Model:</h3>

                        Press firmly around the edges.

                        Smooth the center square.

                        <p>
                        <h5> What you need </h5>

                        1 square sheet of paper (10x10 cm or bigger)

                        Your fingers for shaping (no tools needed)

                        <h3>1. Start With a Square:</h3>

                        Place the paper flat on the table.

                        <h3>2. Fold Diagonal:</h3>

                        Fold corner to corner to form a triangle. Crease gently.

                        <h3>3. Fold in Half Again:</h3>

                        Fold the triangle in half (small triangle). Crease lightly.

                        <h3>4. Open the Last Fold:</h3>

                        Open back to a bigger triangle.

                        You now have one center guiding crease.

                        <h3>5. Make Accordion Folds:</h3>

                        Starting at one side, fold a small strip upward

                        Flip and fold again (like a fan)

                        Continue until the whole triangle is folded

                        This creates the leaf veins look.

                        Sculpting (Shaping the Paper)

                        Now we do gentle shaping so the leaf looks natural.

                        <h3>6. Open the Fan Slightly:</h3>

                        Open the folds just a little so the leaf becomes wider.

                        <h3>7. Curve the Leaf:</h3>

                        Hold both ends and curve the leaf upward slightly.
                        Use soft pressure, no sharp bends.

                        <h3>8. Shape the Tip:</h3>

                        Pinch the very tip gently for a pointed leaf look.

                        <h3>9. Add Natural Waves (Optional):</h3>

                        Using fingers:

                        Press the edges gently to form small waves

                        This gives a soft, sculpted appearance

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 rectangular sheet of paper (A4 size works well)

                        Flat table

                        No scissors or glue needed

                        <h3>1. Fold in Half Horizontally:</h3>

                        Place the paper landscape style (wide side toward you).

                        Fold the top edge to the bottom edge. Crease and open.

                        This creates a center crease.

                        <h3>2. Fold in Half Vertically:</h3>

                        Fold the left edge to the right edge. Crease and open.

                        You will now have two creases intersecting at the center.

                        <h3>3. Make the Triangle Folds:</h3>

                        Fold the top-left corner down to the center crease.

                        Fold the top-right corner down to the center crease.

                        The top now forms a triangle shape.

                        <h3>4. Fold the Bottom Corners:</h3>

                        Take the bottom-left corner and fold it up to meet the triangle tip.

                        Repeat with bottom-right corner.

                        You now have a diamond shape.

                        <h3>5. Fold the Sides for Frog Legs:</h3>

                        Fold the left and right edges toward the center line.

                        These will become the frog's back legs.

                        <h3>6. Fold the Frog in Half:</h3>

                        Fold the entire model backwards horizontally, so the legs are on the outside.

                        Press gently to crease.

                        <h3>7. Make the Jumping Fold:</h3>

                        Fold the back corners outward to make the frog's hind legs.

                        Press lightly to create small triangles pointing backward.

                        <h3>8. Make the Frog Jump:</h3>

                        Place the frog on a flat surface.

                        Press down gently on the back and release — it should jump forward!

                        <p>
                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 rectangular paper (A4 or letter size)

                        Flat table

                        Large paper makes folding easier for elders.

                        <h3>1. Fold in Half (Top to Bottom):</h3>

                        Place paper vertically (tall side up).

                        Fold the top edge to the bottom edge.

                        Press the crease and then open it back up.

                        This gives you a center crease.

                        <h3>2. Fold Left & Right Edges to Center:</h3>

                        Take the left edge and fold it to the center crease.

                        Take the right edge and fold it to the center crease.

                        Now the paper looks like a door shape.

                        <h3>3. Form the Bottle Neck:</h3>

                        At the top part, fold both top corners inward slightly to form a narrower neck.

                        This makes the top smaller than the body (bottle shape).

                        <h3>4. Fold the Shoulders of the Bottle:</h3>

                        Just below the neck, fold the left and right sides outward a little.

                        This creates a rounded shoulder for the bottle.

                        <h3>5. Make the Bottle Bottom:</h3>

                        At the bottom, fold the edge upward about 1-2 cm.

                        Press gently.

                        This makes a flat base.

                        <h3>6. Shape the Neck (Optional):</h3>

                        For a nice neck shape:

                        Fold a small part of the top edge backward.

                        This creates a cap area.

                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 rectangular sheet of paper (A4 or Letter size)

                        Flat table

                        Large paper makes folding easy for elders.

                        <h3>1. Place Paper on the Table:</h3>

                        Put the paper horizontally (landscape) in front of you.

                        <h3>2. Fold Bottom Edge Up:</h3>

                        Take the bottom long edge and fold it up about 3-4 cm.

                        Press gently to crease.

                        This will become the bridge side wall.

                        <h3>3. Fold Top Edge Down:</h3>

                        Take the top long edge and fold it down about 3-4 cm.

                        Press gently to crease.

                        Now you have two folded side walls (these are the sides of the bridge).

                        <h3>4. Make the Bridge Road:</h3>

                        Now fold the entire paper in half, top to bottom.

                        Press lightly, then open back up.

                        This creates a middle guide crease.

                        <h3>5. Form the Bridge Arch:</h3>

                        Hold the paper at both ends.

                        Gently push down in the center while lifting the sides.

                        The paper will form a soft curved arch.

                        No sharp folding here—just gentle shaping with hands.

                        <h3>6. Stand the Bridge:</h3>

                        Place it on the table with:

                        The folded strips as side supports

                        The curved part as the bridge road

                        If it sits unevenly, adjust the folds slightly.

                        <p>
                        <h5> What you need</h5>

                        1 square sheet of paper (15x15 cm or larger)

                        Flat surface

                        Larger paper makes folding easier.

                        <h3>1. Start With a Square</h3>

                        Place the paper color side down (if there is color).

                        <h3>2. Fold in Half (Top to Bottom):</h3>

                        Fold the top edge down to the bottom edge.

                        Press the crease gently.

                        This forms a rectangle.

                        <h3>3. Fold in Half (Left to Right):</h3>

                        Fold the rectangle left to right.

                        Press lightly, then open back up.

                        This gives a center guide line.

                        <h3>4. Fold Top Corners Down:</h3>

                        Take the top-left corner and fold it toward the center line.

                        Take the top-right corner and fold it toward the center line.

                        Now the top looks like a triangle sitting on a rectangle.

                        <h3>5. Fold Bottom Corners Up:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom-left corner upward to meet the center.

                        Repeat with the bottom-right corner.

                        Now both top and bottom edges are tapered inward.

                        <h3>6. Fold Bottom Edge Up:</h3>

                        Fold the entire bottom edge up about 1-2 cm.

                        This forms the chin area of the mask.

                        <h3>7. Fold Sides for Mask Cheeks:</h3>

                        Fold left side inward slightly (about 1 cm).

                        Fold right side inward slightly.

                        These create the cheek shapes of the samurai mask.

                        <h3>8. Form the Helmet Band:</h3>

                        At the top, fold down a small strip (about 1 cm).

                        This creates the helmet band across the forehead.

                        <h3>9. Open Slightly & Adjust:</h3>

                        Gently open the mask just a little.

                        Flatten the folds so the face shape shows clearly.

                        <h5> What you need</h5>
                        1 rectangular sheet of paper (A4 or Letter size works best)

                        Flat table

                        <h3>1. Place Paper Vertically:</h3>

                        Put the paper in front of you so it is tall (portrait).

                        <h3>2. Fold Bottom Edge Up:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom long edge up to about two-thirds of the paper.

                        Press gently to crease.

                        (This will form the pocket of the envelope.)

                        <h3>3. Fold the Top Edge Down:</h3>

                        Fold the top long edge down until it overlaps the folded bottom section.

                        Press the crease.

                        (This creates the closing flap of the envelope.)

                        <h3>4. Fold Side Edges In:</h3>

                        Unfold everything gently.

                        Now fold left side inward about 1-2 cm.

                        Fold right side inward about 1-2 cm.

                        (This makes the sides neat and helps the envelope close.)

                        <h3>5. Reform the Pocket:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom section up again along the same crease.

                        Now you'll see a pocket space (envelope body).

                        <h3>6. Fold the Top Flap:</h3>

                        Fold the top part down again along the same crease.

                        This becomes the seal flap of the envelope.

                        <h5> What you need</h5>
                        1 square sheet of paper (15x15 cm or bigger)

                        Flat table

                        Bigger paper makes folding easier.

                        <h3>1. Start With the Paper Colored Side Down:</h3>

                        If your paper has color, place the colored side facing the table.

                        <h3>2. Fold Into a Triangle:</h3>

                        Fold the square corner to corner to make a big triangle.

                        Press slowly along the crease.

                        <h3>3. Fold Triangle in Half:</h3>

                        Take the triangle and fold it in half again (small triangle).

                        Crease lightly, then open it back to the bigger triangle.

                        This gives a center line.

                        <h3>4. Fold Bottom Corners Up:</h3>

                        Take the left corner of the triangle and fold it up toward the top corner.

                        Take the right corner and fold it up toward the top corner.

                        The shape now looks like a diamond.

                        These are the rabbit's sides.

                        <h3>5. Flip the Paper Over:</h3>

                        Turn the whole shape over so the folds are facing down.

                        <h3>6. Fold the Left Corner to the Right:</h3>

                        Fold the left pointed corner over to the right pointed corner.

                        Now you have a long shape, with a point at the top.

                        This point will become the ears.

                        <h3>7. Fold Ears Up:</h3>

                        From the sharp top point, fold just the tip upward.

                        This creates two ear points facing up.

                        Flatten gently.

                        <h3>8. Make the Standing Base:</h3>

                        Fold the bottom pointed part slightly upward.

                        This helps the rabbit stand.

                        <h3>9. Open Gently and Adjust:</h3>

                        Open the body slightly.

                        Stand it on the bottom fold.

                        Arrange the ears so they point upward.
